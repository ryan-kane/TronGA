In: Every value in each of the parts of the board (empty, friendly, enemy)
Out: A number that is one of the columns

Activations need to be between 0 and 1.
Try Sigmoid function

A neuron is a function that takes in inputs and outputs a number

A neuron has a vector of weights, taking in a number of inputs.

A layer is a vector of neurons(vector of weights), aka a matrix.

The network is made up of layers(matrices), given a vector of
inputs, the network runs the inputs through the first layer, which runs
the inputs through each neuron, which runs the inputs through each weight, with
the sigmoid function and bias.
